          <h2>The city I grew up in</h2>
          <p>
            I grew up on the countryside in a small town called Mariefred. 
            My mom and dad built a house out in the forest next to a cluster of 5 or so 
            houses. We were a small community but we didn't live far from the actual
            town and later on when i got into school I familirized myself bettwer with proper towns.

          <h2>Friends growing up</h2>

          <p>
           My first friend was my neighbour, for a long time we were best friends and even today we are still good friends. During my first years of
           school my best friend joined me in my class but we also met a third guy who was a perfekt fit into our group. Eventually one of my friends moved schools 
           and the other one and I slowly seperated. But one day a new student joined my class and apparently I had just moved to his city (a neighbour city of Mariefred)
           I got him into playing games and with this another one of my old classmates also found interest in gaming, up until today we three are still really close friends.
